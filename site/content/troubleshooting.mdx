# Troubleshooting & Logs

**When something breaks, go straight to the right log, grab the error, and decide the next action.**

Keep this page open while you build. Fast feedback beats frantic guessing—let the logs guide the fix.

---

## Cursor IDE

**Where to look:** `Cmd/Ctrl + L` opens the chat panel history. `Cmd/Ctrl + `` ` opens the integrated terminal.

**What to look for:** Last failed command, model response errors, stack traces in the terminal.

**First fix steps:**

1. Re-run the command with `--verbose` if available (e.g., `npm run dev -- --verbose`)
2. Highlight the error message and ask Cursor: "Explain this stack trace and propose a fix"
3. If Cursor keeps guessing, paste the relevant file section and restate the requirement plainly

---

## GitHub

**Where to look:** Repo → **Pull Requests** → select PR → **Checks** tab for Actions logs.

**What to look for:** Red ❌ steps, especially `build`, `lint`, or `deploy`.

**First fix steps:**

1. Click the failing job → **View raw logs** to copy the exact error
2. If lint/test failure, reproduce locally with the same command shown in the log
3. For permission or secret issues, confirm the GitHub → Vercel/Supabase integration scopes
4. Restart only after you understand the failure—otherwise you'll burn time waiting

---

## Vercel

**Where to look:** Vercel dashboard → your project → **Deployments** → select the failing build → **Logs**.

**What to look for:** Build step errors (dependency install, Next.js build) or runtime errors after deploy.

**First fix steps:**

1. Match the failing step with the corresponding local command (`pnpm install`, `pnpm build`, etc.)
2. Check **Environment Variables** tab—missing env vars are the #1 production issue
3. If runtime errors appear post-deploy, run `vercel logs <deployment-url>` or open the deployment URL with browser dev tools

---

## Supabase

**Where to look:** Supabase dashboard → project → **Logs** (top nav) or **Table Editor / SQL** for schema errors.

**What to look for:** API errors (Auth, Functions), Postgres errors, rate limit warnings.

**First fix steps:**

1. For migration failures, run `supabase db push` locally and watch the terminal output
2. Database errors often reference a specific table/column—jump to that migration file and verify schema
3. Auth/function issues: open **Authentication → Providers** or **Edge Functions → Logs** for more context
4. If you broke local dev, reset with `supabase db reset` (warn team before wiping data)

---

## General Debugging Process

When you're stuck:

1. **Capture the exact error message** and where it appeared
2. **Note what changed** right before the failure
3. **Share both** in Cursor or with your team
4. **Propose one hypothesis** and one experiment to test it

Don't guess randomly. Form a hypothesis, test it, and iterate.

## Common Issues Quick Reference

| Symptom | Likely Cause | Fix |
|---------|--------------|-----|
| "Unauthorized" or 401 errors | Missing env vars or RLS blocking | Check env vars; add RLS policies or disable temporarily |
| Build fails on Vercel but works locally | Missing env vars on Vercel | Add all `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` vars in Vercel dashboard |
| Supabase query returns empty | RLS enabled without policies | Add `allow select` policy or disable RLS for testing |
| Git push rejected | Remote has changes you don't | Run `git pull` first, resolve conflicts |
| "Module not found" errors | Missing dependency | Run `npm install` or `pnpm install` |
