# Dev Environment Setup

**Get your tools and accounts ready so you can develop, deploy, and collaborate.**

This page walks you through setting up GitHub, Git, Node.js, Vercel, Supabase, and Cursor IDE. All other tools connect through GitHub, so we start there.

---

## 1. Create Your GitHub Account

All other tools will connect to GitHub, so start here.

- [ ] Go to [github.com](https://github.com/) and click **Sign up**
- [ ] Create a username, email, and password
- [ ] Verify your email (check your inbox and click the GitHub link)
- [ ] (Optional) Add a profile photo and full name
- [ ] Stay signed in—you'll use GitHub to log into other tools

---

## 2. Install Git

Git is version control software that tracks changes to your code and syncs with GitHub.

### macOS

- [ ] Open **Terminal**
- [ ] If you don't have Homebrew, install it from [brew.sh](https://brew.sh/)
- [ ] Run:

```bash
brew install git
```

- [ ] Verify installation:

```bash
git --version
```

### Windows

- [ ] Go to [git-scm.com/download/win](https://git-scm.com/download/win)
- [ ] Run the installer and accept defaults
- [ ] Open **Git Bash** or **PowerShell**
- [ ] Verify installation:

```bash
git --version
```

### Set Your Git Identity

Run these commands with your name and email (use the same email as your GitHub account):

```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "you@example.com"
```

---

## 3. Install Node.js

Node.js is needed to run JavaScript tools like Next.js and various CLIs.

- [ ] Go to [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/)
- [ ] Download the **LTS version** (not Current)
- [ ] Run the installer and accept defaults
- [ ] Verify installation:

```bash
node --version
npm --version
```

---

## 4. Set Up Vercel

Vercel hosts your frontend and handles automatic deployments from GitHub.

- [ ] Go to [vercel.com/signup](https://vercel.com/signup)
- [ ] Click **Continue with GitHub**
- [ ] Approve GitHub access (so Vercel can see your repos)
- [ ] In the dashboard, click **New Project → Import Git Repository**
- [ ] Select your repo and click **Deploy**
- [ ] Note your project URL once deployed

### Optional: Vercel CLI

```bash
npm install -g vercel
vercel login
```

Follow the login prompt in your browser.

---

## 5. Set Up Supabase

Supabase provides your PostgreSQL database and authentication.

- [ ] Go to [supabase.com](https://supabase.com/)
- [ ] Click **Start your project** or **Sign in**, then **Continue with GitHub**
- [ ] Approve GitHub access
- [ ] In your dashboard, click **New Project** and give it a name
- [ ] Choose the free tier and wait for project creation

### Optional: Supabase CLI

**macOS:**

```bash
brew install supabase/tap/supabase
```

**Windows:**

```bash
npm install -g supabase
```

Verify installation:

```bash
supabase --version
```

### For Local Development

If you plan to run Supabase locally, install [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop).

---

## 6. Install Cursor IDE

Cursor is an AI-powered code editor that will help you generate and refine code.

- [ ] Go to [cursor.com](https://cursor.com/)
- [ ] Click **Download Cursor**
- [ ] Install the app (`.dmg` on Mac, `.exe` on Windows)
- [ ] Open Cursor and **Sign in with GitHub**
- [ ] Approve GitHub access to enable repo features
- [ ] Create or open a new project folder

---

## 7. Verify Everything Works

Open Terminal (or Git Bash on Windows) and run these commands one by one:

```bash
git --version
node --version
npm --version
vercel --version    # if you installed Vercel CLI
supabase --version  # if you installed Supabase CLI
```

Then confirm:

- [ ] Cursor is open and you're logged in
- [ ] Vercel dashboard shows your GitHub profile
- [ ] Supabase dashboard shows your GitHub profile

**You're ready to build!**
