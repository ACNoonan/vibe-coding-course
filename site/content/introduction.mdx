# Introduction

**Master the art of building software with AI—not just for today's tools, but for tomorrow's.**

This course teaches you the **engineering mindset and systematic workflow** that will keep you productive no matter how the toolset changes. You'll learn to think like a systems architect while moving at startup speed—planning deliberately, prompting precisely, and iterating intelligently.

## What You'll Learn

- **Strategic Planning:** How to translate problems into structured requirements that AI can execute
- **Prompt Engineering for Developers:** Crafting system-level prompts that generate production-ready schemas and UI flows
- **The Vibe Coding Workflow:** A repeatable process from concept to deployment
- **Integration Mastery:** Connecting Supabase, GitHub, and frontend builders into a coherent development stack
- **Intelligent Iteration:** Using AI-powered IDEs to refine and enhance generated code
- **Tool-Agnostic Thinking:** Building mental models that transfer across platforms as AI tooling evolves

## Course Structure

Follow along with the worksheets and guides to build your own MVP from scratch:

**Foundation**

- **[Finding Flow](/finding-flow)** - The mindset and rhythm of vibe coding (read this next!)

**Core path**

1. **[Dev Environment Setup](/dev-environment-setup)** - Get your tools and accounts ready
2. **[Planning Worksheet](/planning-worksheet)** - Transform ideas into structured requirements
3. **[Build with AI Flow](/build-with-ai-flow)** - The complete systematic workflow
4. **[Troubleshooting & Logs](/troubleshooting)** - Diagnose issues fast across platforms

**Advanced track**

- **[CLI Services](/advanced/cli-services)** - Master Git, Supabase CLI, and development workflows
- **[Self-Hosting 101](/advanced/self-hosting-101)** - Deploy to your own infrastructure (optional)

## Who This Is For

- Developers curious about AI-assisted development
- Product managers who want to prototype faster
- Entrepreneurs building their first technical MVP
- Anyone who's struggled to turn AI conversations into actual, working software

## Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of web applications (frontend/backend concepts)
- Comfort with using web-based tools and following technical instructions
- A laptop with modern browser and willingness to create free accounts
- No prior AI experience required—we'll build that together

Ready to start? Begin with [Finding Flow](/finding-flow) to understand the mindset, then continue to [Dev Environment Setup](/dev-environment-setup) to get your tools ready.
