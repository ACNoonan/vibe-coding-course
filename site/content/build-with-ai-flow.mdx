# Build with AI Flow

**Use this run sheet while building.** It keeps you in a consistent Cursor-guided loop: plan, prompt, implement, verify.

---

## Quick Run Sheet

1. **Frame the task** — Restate the user story or bug in one sentence
2. **Prep Cursor** — Open the repo, highlight key files, feed the goal and constraints
3. **Generate plan** — Ask for a minimal change list; confirm or trim
4. **Apply changes** — Let Cursor write files, review diff together, iterate fast
5. **Verify** — Run local command or deployment check; log issues in [Troubleshooting](/troubleshooting)

Repeat until the user story is complete and merged.

---

## 1. Kickoff and Planning

- Pull from `main` and run the project. Confirm you're on the latest commit.
- Review the worksheet outputs from [Planning Worksheet](/planning-worksheet) to anchor scope.
- In Cursor chat, paste the current objective and any guardrails (tech stack, UX must-haves, data constraints).

**Prompt starter:**

```text
We are continuing the [Project Name] app. Current status: [brief summary].
Objective: [single user story].
Constraints: [bullets].
Return: a short implementation plan with files to touch, pre-checks, and verifications.
```

---

## 2. Structure the Work

- Use the AI plan as a checklist; keep only the steps you truly need.
- Assign roles if working in a group: one person drives Cursor, one tests, others check docs or schema.
- Capture new tasks or risks in your worksheet backlog so nothing is forgotten.

**Checkpoint:** Plan fits on one screen, every step maps to a repo change or validation.

---

## 3. Pair with Cursor

- For UI or schema updates, highlight relevant files before prompting to give Cursor context.
- Keep prompts tight: what changed, what to create, expected output format.
- Let Cursor write, then immediately scan the diff for misalignments. Reject and re-prompt quickly if it strays.

**When Cursor guesses wrong:**

1. Explain the mismatch ("We need Supabase Row Level Security, not fake auth.")
2. Paste the correct snippet or docs link
3. Re-run with the clarified constraint

---

## 4. Test and Iterate

After each meaningful change, run the smallest verification possible:

- `npm run dev` or `vercel dev` for frontend
- `supabase db diff` / `db push` for schema
- Unit or integration tests if available

Note any failing command, then jump to the matching section in [Troubleshooting](/troubleshooting).

Capture resolved issues so you build a troubleshooting habit over time.

---

## 5. Merge and Deploy

- Once the story works locally, create a focused commit:

```bash
git commit -m "feat: add RSVP form validation"
```

- Push and open a pull request; review line-by-line.
- Merge to `main` when approved. Let Vercel auto-deploy or run `vercel --prod`.
- Celebrate the win, then queue the next objective.

## Sample Prompts Library

### Generate Supabase Migration

```text
You are designing a PostgreSQL migration for Supabase.
Task: add a `restaurant_preferences` table tied to `events`.
Include indexes for lookups by `event_id`, set defaults, and enable RLS (policies later).
Return only SQL.
```

### Update a UI Component

```text
We added Supabase restaurant preferences. Update `components/RestaurantForm.tsx`
to display existing preferences and add a toggle for `requires_accessibility`.
Keep styling consistent with Tailwind classes already in the file.
```

Keep adding winning prompts here so each session benefits from the last.

---

## Timeboxing Tips

| Phase | Time |
|-------|------|
| Plan + prep prompts | 15 minutes |
| Implement with Cursor | 25 minutes |
| Verify, document, push | 10 minutes |

Adjust the timer but keep the rhythm. Flow comes from short feedback loops.

---

## Key Principles

- **Plan with intention** — Know what you're building before you prompt
- **Prompt with clarity** — Be specific about constraints and expected output
- **Verify relentlessly** — Don't trust; confirm

Cursor becomes the accelerator, not the driver. You stay in control.
